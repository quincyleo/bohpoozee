                            <p>My kanav2 dosent show up on steelseries engine? is there a fix for it or is it not supported Hello ! When i use the mouse 4 or 5 on a rival 300 on chrome it goes back/forward. How can i change them to none as there is no option on steelseries engine 3? I managed to do than on engine 2 with a kana v2. I don`t want to disable them because i`m using mouse4 Is the kana v2 still not supported by steelseries engine? i cant find out if it is or not, it dosent show up there. My Kana V2 from Aliexpress finally shipped yesterday, and it's a real product. I decided to review it because I'm really liking it so far. Pros: Best switches I've ever used. Better than the DA 3.5G and the Kinzu V3 definitely. Really comfortable shape with side buttons that are precise and large. I never found myself misclicking the one on the right side, and the mouse is a great step-up from the Kinzu. The A3090 sensor, great implementation, 400-4000 dpi steps, I can't notice. Hi, I have been using my Kana v2 for 2 years now, and noticed after awhile that when i use the left and right side buttons, the mouse sensitivity will change. The left side button lowers sensitivity, and the right side button increases sensitivity. I am using the steelseries engine 2, and when the sensitivity changes in this manner, the settings in the engine remains constant. And any such sensitivity changes will be reset whenever i restart my computer, so it is impossible to find a constant. Hi, So as the title says, I've purchased the steelseries kana v2 off of pccasegear (I live in Australia) and both times within a year the scrollwheel has turned faulty. By this I mean every time I scroll down, it wants to flick up. This is incredibly irritating. I love steelseries mice though, from the moment I had my kana v2 I was in love. I don't want to go back to razer or logitech, as I feel they're overpriced and filled with too much BS. So, I'm looking at getting a rival. I just found. I am currently in the market for a new mouse as the primary switch in my Steelseries Kana is quite worn. My problem is that my mouse grip is kind of weird. When i am gaming i use a palm grip, but instead of having my ring finger on the right side of the mouse, i have both my middle finger AND my ring finger on the secondary button. Here's a picture for reference. ( When i am just browsing the internet i am using a fingertip grip, but i have my middle. Is there any chance of the Kana V2 getting SteelSeries Engine support? Would be nice to be able to change the settings for the DPI button. 
Steelseries engine does not find my steelseries kana v2. Just says "Plug in a steelseries device to get started" i've tried to reinstall the program but that does not fix anything. I don't know if this subreddit is good for that question, if not then tell me where should I ask. So I need to make mouse macro for button 5 (steelseries kana v2 mouse, this button is located next to the left click). I tried doing it in Steelseries Engine 2 (SE 3 doesn't support Kana v2) but there is no option to loop the macro on holding a key. I need to make macro like when I hold button 5 then it's repeating sequence "press r, wait 64ms, press t, wait 64ms". I was looking into software. Hi all, I've had SteelSeries Kana V2 for a while now, played on my PC at home but now I'm in college and didn't bring my PC. Now on a Mac (El Capitan) and Engine 2 isn't installing. Any fixes? Cheers. I bought a kana v2, installed steelseries engine 3 and it doesn't recognize the mouse "Plug in a SteelSeries device to get started", the older versions of the drivers are alright but they don't have the options i want to use, so yeah. is kana v2 simply not supported in the ss engine. I have a SS Kana v2 using SS engine 2. I'm planning to get Steelseries headset which uses ss engine 3. Can I use the mouse with SS engine 3? Or can I use both engine together? Any way to ensure both hardware work smoothly. I have 2 Logitech mouse, and they both have detailed descriptions and high res images that i can see in Control Panel/Devices and printers. Why there is no such a thing for my steelseries mouse (Kana v2 black) (+ Kana v2 has 2 slot in device list.). It doesn't affect performance or anything, but it's just a little detail that most of the peripherals have i use daily, but not the only steelseries peripheral i use (for almost a month now). How it looks in Control Panel - Devices (http://i.im. Hello, today i installed the 3rd version of the steelseries engine, and after the installation i started the program and then it says "Plug in a SteelSeries to get started", i tried all the usb ports and still get the same "message", i alse tried to update the firmware via the SteelSeries engine v2.8 which is the on the the kana section, well after installing the update firmware nothing had happened. Thank you. (Here's the picture of the "error" i'm getting). Download the SteelSeries Engine 3 software for the best gaming experience on Windows
